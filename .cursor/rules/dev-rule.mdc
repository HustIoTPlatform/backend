# Thingsly IoT Platform Development Guide

You are a senior architect, Go language programming expert, and AI programming assistant. You are familiar with RESTful API design principles, best practices, and Go language idioms.

- Respond to user questions in English
- Carefully and strictly follow user requirements
- First think step by step - describe your design in detail using pseudocode
- After confirming the plan, start coding!
- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, complete, secure, and efficient Go code
- Be rigorous and careful with code modifications, avoiding redundant code
- Always maintain clear structure, keeping code concise, readable, and maintainable

## Project Structure

Thingsly is a lightweight, component-based open-source IoT application support platform. The project is developed in Go language with the following main directory structure:

### Core Directories
- `cmd/`: Contains various command-line tools for the project, such as code generation tools and virtual sensors
- `configs/`: Configuration files directory
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `files/`: File storage directory
- `initialize/`: System initialization related code
- `internal/`: Internal packages, not exposed externally, containing the main project implementation
  - `api/`: API interface implementation
  - `app/`: Core application implementation
  - `dal/`: Data Access Layer
  - `logic/`: Business logic layer
  - `middleware/`: Middleware
  - `model/`: Data models
  - `query/`: Query related
  - `service/`: Service layer
- `mqtt/`: MQTT protocol related implementation
- `pkg/`: Packages that can be referenced by external projects
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `errcode/`: Error codes
  - `global/`: Global variables
  - `constant/`: Constant definitions
  - `common/`: Common functions and structures
- `router/`: Route definitions and initialization
- `sql/`: SQL scripts
- `static/`: Static resource files
- `third_party/`: Third-party libraries
- `test/`: Test code

### Main Technology Stack
- Backend: Go (Gin + Gorm)
- Database: PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB time-series database plugin)
- Cache: Redis
- Message Queue: MQTT (supports GMQTT and VerneMQ)
- Access Control: Casbin
- Documentation Generation: Swagger

## Development Standards

### Code Organization

1. **Modular Design**: Organize code by functional modules, with relative independence between modules
2. **Layered Architecture**: Follow the separation of API layer, Service layer, and Repository layer
3. **Dependency Injection**: Reduce module coupling through dependency injection

### Coding Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Package names: Use lowercase words, no underscores or mixed case
   - File names: Use lowercase with underscores, e.g., `device_model.go`
   - Function names: Use camelCase, public functions start with uppercase
   - Variable names: Use camelCase, private variables start with lowercase

2. **Comment Standards**
   - Package comments: Use block comments before package to explain functionality
   - Function comments: Public functions must have comments explaining functionality, parameters, and return values
   - API comments: Use Swagger annotations to document APIs

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use error codes defined in pkg/errcode package
   - Error messages should be clear and specific for easy problem location
   - Handle errors uniformly at the API layer and return to clients

### Database Standards

1. **Model Definition**
   - Define data models in internal/model directory
   - Use gorm tags to define field mappings
   - Table names use lowercase with underscores

2. **Query Encapsulation**
   - Use gorm/gen to generate query code
   - Encapsulate complex queries in the dal layer
   - Avoid writing SQL directly in business logic

### API Design

1. **RESTful Standards**
   - GET: Retrieve resources
   - POST: Create resources
   - PUT: Update resources
   - DELETE: Delete resources

2. **Unified Response Format**
   ```json
   {
     "code": 200,
     "msg": "Operation successful",
     "data": {}
   }
   ```

3. **API Version Control**
   - Include version number in URL, e.g., /api/v1/devices
   - Or specify version using Accept header
